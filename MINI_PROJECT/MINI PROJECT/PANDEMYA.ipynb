    "As the ice in the poles melts, a new virus capable of infecting humans has emerged in Norway. This virus is more contagious and deadlier than Covid-19. Scientists are calling this the imminent start of a second pandemic. A group of people in Norway are resistant to the virus. A data scientist, Maik, realized this group shares one thing in common; they all have the same vaccine profile for Covid-19. This means the right combination of Covid-19 vaccines is preventing the new virus from infecting vaccinated humans. Unfortunately, Maik got infected and died before he could divulge the right combination of vaccines. However, he left a notebook with some information:\n",
